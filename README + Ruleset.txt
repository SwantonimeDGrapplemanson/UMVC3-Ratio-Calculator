App Description: 		-"The UMVC3 Ratio + Ban Manager Tool" is a desktop application designed to manage the considerations that need to be made when playing the "Ratio + Ban" ruleset developed by Tennessee Luna, 
				 	based off of the current Ratio chart developed and adopted by the UMVC3 community. 
					The maximum ratio is 10 points at default, character ratio values are the same, but Vergil is not a permanently banned character. 
					Vergil is worth 9 points. This prices him out of team building consideration initially, but through the ban system, he does become an accessible character. 
				

				-"The UMVC3 Ratio + Ban Manager Tool" for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 allows a manager to handle the strategic character bans and the mathematics of the ratio point system
					when building teams for player 1 and player 2. The application facilitates fair and balanced team creation by enforcing ratio limits and allowing players to utilize 
					'additive' and 'subtractive' bans to influence team composition and ratio flexibility.

				-Click on characters from the character pool to compose a team. Toggle between player 1 and player 2 selections and bans.

				-Ctrl + Mouse Click will initiate an 'additive' ban. This gives the opponent an additional point for their maximum ratio value, allowing for more powerful team compositions 
				 	and an even more dangerous character.

				-Shift + Mouse Click will initiate a 'subtractive' ban. This deducts a point from the maximum ratio value of the player conducting the ban, constricting their ability to compose a team 
				 	of strong characters as freely as their opponent.

				-The strategy of ban picks revolves around hindering your opponents ability to use their most dangerous and accomplished characters, 
					in exchange for devaluing your potential or increasing theirs. Use wisely.

Ruleset:			-Team Composition:
					Each player builds a team of three UMVC3 characters, handled by the user who is managing the manager tool. These picks will then be selected in-game.

				-Ratio Enforcement:
					Teams must adhere to a maximum ratio (initially 10 points), preventing overpowered team combinations and encouraging underexplored, creative team compisitions.

				-Character Ratios:
					Uses a defined ratio value for each character to calculate team totals.

Key Features:			-Two-Player Team Drafting:
					Supports team building for two players independently and simulateously.

				-Dynamic UI:
					Interactive graphical interface with character buttons that dynamically update their enabled/disabled state based on team composition, ratio limits, and ban status. 

				-Real-time Feedback:
					Displays current team composition, team ratio, and remaining ratio points for each player.

				-Team Reset:
					Allows players to clear their team and start team selection from scratch.

				-Strategic Bans:
					Each player can choose one 'additive' and one 'subtractive' ban during team drafting.

				-Additive Ban (#AdditiveBan):
					A player bans a character, making it unavailable to both players. The opponent of the ban initiator gains a +1 bonus to their maximum ratio.

				-Subtractive Ban(#SubtractiveBan):
					A player bans a character, making it unavailable to both players. The ban initiator receives a -1 penalty to their maximum ratio.

				-Ban Tracking:
					Visually displays which 'additive' and 'subtractive' bans are in effect for each player.

				-Player-Specific Ban Reset:
					Players can independently reset their chosen 'additive' ban and 'subtractive' ban and revert ratio adjustments accordingly.
